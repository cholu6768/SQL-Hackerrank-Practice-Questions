# 📒 SQL HackerRank Practice Questions 

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-love.svg)](https://forthebadge.com) ![forthebadge](made-with-mysql.svg)

This repository includes my answers for the SQL practice questions provided by [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard). 

The questions can be answered in 4 different types of SQL flavours and I decided to answer them using MySQL.

The questions are divided into 6 types: 
- Basic Select 
- Aggregation
- Basic Joins
- Advanced Select 
- Advanced Joins
- Alternative Queries

> So far I have answered 45 out of 58 questions. The repository will get updated from time to time when I answer more of the questions.
